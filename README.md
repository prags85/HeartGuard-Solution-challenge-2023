# HeartGuard: GDSC Solution challenge 2023
Cardiovascular diseases have increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for 19.7 million deaths worldwide. The number of deaths in India alone, stands at 4.77 million per year as of 2020. They have spiked by 60% globally in the last 30 years, owing to increased alcoholism, blood pressure, and physical inactivity among the main reasons. Four out of every five CVD deaths occur in middle to low-income countries. CVDs are detected using a number of laboratory tests and imaging studies, encompassing the patient's medical history along with his family's medical history. It also includes factors like age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels coloured by fluoroscopy, thalassemia type, and a target variable related to cardiovascular¬†health.



## About Dataset
Heart Disease Prediction dataset contains records about diagnosis of heart disease based on multiple factors like Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting Electrocardiographic Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak (ST Depression), Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment, Number of Major Vessels (Colored by Fluoroscopy) and Thalassemia. The data set dates from 1988 and consists of data from four countries: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. There are 304 recors based on 14 attributes (9 categorical and 5 continuous).

## Machine Learning Algorithm
The project employs the following machine learning algorithms:
## Logistic Regression
The Logistic Classifier is a fundamental tool in supervised learning, specifically designed for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, utilizing a logistic function. It is widely employed due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability.

## Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier, belonging to the ensemble learning category, is a versatile tool suitable for both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

##  Decision Tree Classifier
The Decision Tree Classifier is a straightforward and interpretable supervised learning algorithm. It partitions the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure. Decision trees are advantageous for their ease of understanding and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

## AdaBoost Classifier
The AdaBoost Classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions from multiple weak learners, often decision trees, to create a strong classifier. It assigns higher weights to misclassified instances in each iteration, emphasizing difficult-to-classify data points and improving overall accuracy.

##  Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, particularly useful for text classification and spam filtering. Despite its "naive" assumption of independence between features, it often performs well and is computationally efficient.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a versatile and intuitive method for both classification and regression tasks. It classifies an instance based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Deep Neural Network (DNN)
The Deep Neural Network (DNN) represents a powerful class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain's neural networks. It excels in learning intricate patterns and representations from data, making it suitable for complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.

##  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 
 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique. It seeks to find the linear combinations of features that best separate different classes in the dataset, making it particularly useful in scenarios with multiple classes.
